# Building A Library Of Books Using REACT

## Books Library 📚  

This is my first React project built using **Vite** and React. It’s a simple web application where users can access a collection of books in PDF format. Each book is linked directly to its downloadable PDF file, providing an easy and user-friendly experience.  

## Features ✨  
- A list of books with links to their PDF versions.  
- Built with React components and JSX for seamless rendering.  
- Basic styling and functionality for a clean, minimalistic interface.  

## Learning Highlights 📘  
While working on this project, I:  
- Learned how to create and use React components.  
- Understood the concept of props and their role in React.  
- Explored JSX, the syntax extension that combines JavaScript and HTML-like code.  
- Gained insights into deploying React projects with **GitHub Pages**.  

## Challenges Faced 🛠️  
- Encountered issues with image loading during deployment.  
- Solved the problem by using the `import` keyword for image files instead of embedding them directly.  

## Future Improvements 🌱  
- Add more books to the collection.  
- Enhance the UI/UX with better styling and interactivity.  
- Implement a search feature to find books easily.
